                                                            Story:
Nowadays people use social media to express their opinions or to raise views etc ,but people nowadays take the privilege of misusing the 
the effects of social media by  using disgust words, insult people on the basis of sex, cast, religion etc.These kind of abuses affects people in a lot of ways especially mentally and physically. These made us to come up and implement an idea based on this
                                                     Hate Speech Detection in Twitter

                              Predict - Actually helps us to identify whether a particular tweet is hate Speech or not

                                                   What is our Project?
Our project Hate Speech Detection in twitter , basically collects data from twitter and detects the hate words using the five models we have implemented basically SVM, 
Logistic Regression, Random Forest, CNN-LSTM, Fuzzy Model. The accurate model with highest accuracy will be considered as the final result.

                                                   Main Impacts in the Project:
The main impacts in the project are SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, CNN-LSTM, Fuzzy:
1) SVM - Support Vector Machine
2) LR- Logistic Regression
3) RF- Random Forest
4) CNN-LSTM- Covolutional Neural Network and Long-Short Term Memory
5) Fuzzy Model

                                                   Technologies Used:
1) Machine Learning Algorithms
2) Flask
3) HTML,CSS
4) Python 
5) Javascript
