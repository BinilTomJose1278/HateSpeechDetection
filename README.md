                           Story:
In the modern world people use social media to express their opinions ,to raise views  etc, but people nowadays take the privelage of misusing the 
the effects of social media by  using disgust words, insult people on the basis of sex, cast, religion etc.These kind of abuses affects people in a lot of ways especially mentally
and physically. These made us to come up and implement an idea based on this.

                                                               What is our Project?
Our project Hate Speech Detection in twitter , basically collects data from twiiter and detects the hate words using the five models we have implemented basically SVM, 
Logistic Regression, Random Forest, CNN-LSTM, Fuzzy Model. The accurate model with highest accuracy will be considered as the final result.

                                                              Main Impacts in the Project:
The main impacts in the project are SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, CNN-LSTM, Fuzzy
SVM - Support Vector Machine
LR- Logistic Regression
RF- Random Forest
CNN-LSTM- Covolutional Neural Network and Long-Short Term Memory
Fuzzy Model

                                                               Technologies Used:
1) Machine Learning Algorithms
2) Flask
